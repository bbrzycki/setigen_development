02_closed_form_chirp_spectrum.ipynb

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp_spectrum#Linear_chirp,
adapt derivation to write analytical chirp spectrum. Wrote a 
tutorial in setigen/jupyter-notebooks/spectrogram on how to do 
this and show it out.

Looks decent but obviously only covers linearly drifting cosine signals.

Experiment with numerical estimation of drifting for extended signals.
Made branch `doppler_smearing` in setigen to test. Added parameter `num_smear` for now, 
maybe should change since it's a bit weird. At this point it basically adds that many copies at equal intervals between path f_center values, and divides out by num_smear. This way, drifting frequency values will naturally be attenuated without having to estimate how wide signals really are.

Added unit_drift_rate attribute to frame, for convenience.
